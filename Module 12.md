# Module 12 : Fire protection and safety
## Factor causing fire
- Overloading
- Bad connection
- Dust
- Storage under raise floor area
- Yearly thermalgraphic scanning
## Requirement for Data Centre Fire suspression
- Detect as early as possible
- Safe for human
- Environmentally friendly
- Effectively put out fire
- Minimize or no damage to sensitive equipment
- Comply with national and building code
## Standards
- Safety measures
- Gas / flooding system allowable
- Cardio-toxicity and allowable exposure level:
  - No Observed Adversed Effect Level (NOAEL)
  - Lowest Observed Adversed Effect Level (LOAEL)
## Detection System
- Very Early Smoke Detection System (VESDA)
- Highly Sensitive Smoke Detection (HSSD)

Works via air sampling

1000 times more sensitive than standard smoke detectors

Care must be taken during drilling or hacking

- Smoke detectors
  - Ionization detectors
    - smoke ions create electrical path
  - Photoelectric detector
    - deflection of light
  - Sprinkles
    - Activate at 70 C
  - Concealed Sprinkles
    - Cover plate drop at 57 C
## Fire suspression system
Dry vs Wet, Dry first before wet for DC
- water mist
  - extract heat from fire and create barrier to oxygen supply
  - high humudity, might damage equipment
- Halon 1301
  - Deplete ozone layer
- CO2
  - Cheap
  - Cost-effective
  - Harmful to human, Lethal at 34%
- FM200
  - remain in the area for long period
  - cause environmental issue (HFC)
  - harmful gas if burned
  - cannot refill on site
- Novec
  - can be refill on site
- Inergen
  - High pressure, can be placed far
  - Allow for zoning
  - Large storage required
  - cannot refill on site
- Argonite
  - High pressure
  - cannot refill on site
  - reduce oxygen down to 12.5% (fire require 15%)
- FE13 (HFC-23)
  - High Ceiling
- Pyrogen
  - small room
  - self-generated aerosol fire extinguishing agent
## Fire prevention
- Hypoxic air fire prevention
  - Reduce oxygen level to typically around 15%
 
## Best practices
- Install VESDA/HSSD
- Gas based as primary system
- Pre-action sprinkler system as secondary system
- Room is properly sealed
- Ensure gas content is enough to achieve concentration level
- Extration vents for gas
- Proper maintenance

## Handheld extinguishers
- Class A
  - wood, cloth, paper
  - water based
- Class B
  - combustible or flammable liquids
  - gas based
- Class C
  - electrical equipment
  - gas based, Halon, dry chemical
- Class D
  - combustible metal like sodium, lithium
  - dry powder
- Class K
  - cooking fats or oil
  - extinguishing agent comes as liquid chemical
 
## Signage
- Exit
- Evacuate area immediately
- Alarm bell
- Strobe light
- Gas release abort
- Gas manual release

## Regulatory requirements
- EPO
- Auto unlock doors (swing out)
- Escape route should be clear and within distance
- Automatic shutdown of air conditioners
- Integration with existing building fire panel
- Gas manual release and gas abort buttons
- Check local fire-codes
