# Module 1 - The Mission Critical

## Types of Data Centres
* Power, Telecomunications, Environmental Control, Fire Suppression, Safety and Security
### Enterprise
* Solely for internal use
### Co-location
* Data Centre owner provides: Building, Cooling, Power, Connectivity/Bandwidth, Physical Security and Fire safety
* Customer provide Server rack, Storage
* Customer rent full/half rack or entire room
### Cloud
* Off-site Data Centre
* Leases infrastructure to manage by third-party partner and access data centre over the Internet
* Responsible for maintenance, updates, and meet SLA
* SaaS PaaS IaaS
### Hyperscale
* AWS, Microsoft, Google
* Robust, scalable application and storage
* At least 3000m2 / 10000 ft2 in size
* Usually have minimum of 5000 servers
* High Fibre Count
* Provide high responsive, scalable and cost-effective infrastucture
* Network Bandwidth, data management and LB are key concepts
* Power allocation, number of kW and even fractions of MW
### Edge
* Locate close to the edge of network
* Reduce latency - by bringing the infrastructure closer to end users and devices
* Client data are process nearer to the source to delivery fast services with minial latency
* Connect to larger, central data centre or multiple other edge data centres
## Downtime
* Average cost of unplanned data centre outage is $9000
* Maximum downtime is $2,409,991 (still increasing)
* What is at Stake? Cost of Downtime: Revenue / 8760 (hour/year)
  
## Risk factors
1. Natural
  * Heat
  * Cold
  * Flood
  * Earthquake
  * Lightning
  * Air Pollution/Contamination
2. Human
  * Equipment Failure
  * Vandalism
  * Human Errors
  * Terrorism
3. Data Network
  * Network Saturation (Bandwidth)
  * Virus
  * Hackers

## Downtime main cause
Human Errors and Hardware or System Failure
1. Human Errors
  * No or poorly executed process and work instruction
  * Unauthorized Access
  * Accidens
  * Unnotice Alarms
2. Power Quality
  * Poor voltage/current/frequency
  * High level of noise
  * High ground resistance
  * Harmonics ??
3. Environmental
  * Wrong temperature
  * Humidity entering the equipment

## Predominant cause of data centre failures
1. Electro Magnetic Fields (EMF)
  * High radiation from power cables / UPS / Transformers / PDU / Lighting
  * Cand cause health issue
2. Environment conditions
  * Temperature/Humidity
  * Wrong cooling principles
  * High levels of contaminations

## Summary
* Data Centre plays crucial role in High Availability for Business
* They has to be part of (and accomodate) the fast pace of technology changes
* Most of the DC are not ready for tomorrows' technology
* Most DC have experienced changes are potential risk factors for achieving High Availability
* Data Centres are typically design and built to last for at least 5 years or as much as 15 to 20 years. Impossible to plan and buy future equipment sold by the ICT Vendors
* Impossible to build a DC for typical life span of a DC
* Data Centres Managers have to carefully monitor and manage the limit of DC
* Have a pro-active plan in place to ensure the limits are not suddenly exceeded and impact the business.
