# Module 5 : Light

## Light definition and unit of measure
- Light requirement
  - identify object and more concentrate
  - counteract premature fatigue 
- Lighting strength measure: Lumen, Lux (Area)
- eg. 1000 Lumen = 1000 Lux in 1 meter square, 1000 Lumen = 100 Lux in 10 meter square
- Include AREA in the measurement, at least 500 Lux
- Measure with Light Meter
  
## Standards
- Room: 500 - 600 Lux
- Corridors: 200 - 300 Lux
- Service area: 150 - 200 Lux
- TIA 942; three level of light strength depending on location and usage
  - Level 1 : Unoccupied
  - Level 2 : Initial entry, sufficient lighting to allow safe passage
  - Level 3 : Occupied space - maintenance and interaction with equipment, 500 Lux on the ground and 200 Lux on the wall
 
## Light fixtures and placement
- Prefer to use protected types
- Separation of UPS group for IT and Lighting ( especially fluorescent light )
- Location
  - at regular interval
  - in all aisles
  - back of the rack
 
## Emergency Light
- Required to enable a safe escape of personnel during a power failure
- Design in data centre vs office area is different:
  - All equipments in data centre are connected to generator set
- Emergency Lights in big DC are placed along the Rack, small DC are placed on the top
- Place emergency light at lower level to facilitate a safe escape during fire
- Minimun 1 Lux (small room) - 15 Lux (big room)
- Recommend to do more than what is required by the local regulations
- Emergency lights to place at:
  - Switch boards
  - UPS
  - Standby Generator
  - Cooling Equipment
  - Other mission critical equipment
- Torch light
  - Ensure batteries are checked and replaced on regular basis
  - Glow sticks
- Types:
  - LED / Flurescent / Incandescent
- Standalone
  - Troublesome for maintenance
- Centralized (easily centralized maintenance)
  - EPS (Emergency Power Supply)
## Summary
- Unit : Lux
- 500 Lux
- Emergency Lights are placed in critical places
- Torch light/glow sticks
