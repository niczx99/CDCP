# Module 4 : Raised Access Flooring and Suspended Ceiling

## Raised Floor
- Two types
  - Die formed welded steel construction
  - Die formed welded steel shell with cement- or calcium-filled core
- Top finish is normally HPL (High Pressure Laminate)

### Loading Factor
- Uniform Distributed Load (UDL)
  - Over entire area
  - Stationary furniture and equipment without legs
  - Load; kN/m2
- Concentrade Load/Point Load (CL/PL)
  - Small area
  - Stationary furniture and equipment with legs
  - May result in panel deflection and possible permanent set
- Rolling Load (RL)
  - Equipment on wheels
  - More damaging (wave effect), raised floors are typically protected

### Raised floor Standards 
- NFPA 251 : Fire resistant for at least 1 hour
- IEC-61000-4-2, anti-static

### Raised floor weight
- Put in the weight of raised floor when calculating Buidling Floor Load

### Raised floor : General Guidelines
- Height: at least 40cm, preferably 60cm
- Pathway should be kept low to ensure ventilation (air flow)
- Opening must have plastic  edging
- Opening must be properly seal (chromate?)
- Air-conditioning frame to stand clear from raised floor to avoid vibration.
  - Seal with rubber strip to avoid pressure loss (dust)
- Do not make it as store room

### Grounding of raised floor
- Metal need to be grounded ( metal allow current flow )
- Pedastal need to be ground
- Braided Copper or flat copper strip
- Signal Reference Grid
  - High Frequency Current/Noise to dissipate before it cause breakdown of equipment
  - Racks grounding wire connect to Signal Reference Grid to discharge HF current/Noise (serial bonding is not allowed)

### Cutting holes in the raised floor tile
- Draw a X, location of the hole is not touching the line
- Avoid corners

### Ramps
- Access Raised floor
- Length = 1 : 12 ( eg. 40cm = 4.8meter ramp)
- Width = 2 meters
- Landing platform must be same in squre dimensions
- Handrails for safety

### Other considerations
- Disability Acts / local guidelines and regulations
  - Wheel chair route
  - Turning point 1.5m is required
  - Handrails of special design
 
## Suspended Ceiling
- Standard : EN 13964, BS 476 Part 21,22,23
  - Acoustic attenuation, fire resistnace
- Aircon supply cold air, suspended ceiling : hot air to go back (return duct)
- Aesthetics
- Cablings ducts
- Reduce volume of the room
  - reduce fire suppresion gas to protect the room
- Space between raised floor to suspended ceiling should be at least 2.6meter for 42U racks
- Height of suspended ceiling = 2x Raised floor heigh (1.5x min)
- eg. 40cm raised floor, 260cm room, suspended ceiling = 40 + 260 + 40*1.5 = 360cm
- Clearance of 46cm-50cm below water sprinkler
- Check cleanliness and cabling regularly

## Summary
- Standard for raised floor and suspended ceiling
- PL > UDL
