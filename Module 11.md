# Module 11 : Designing a Scalable Network Infrastucture
- Redundancy is important other than power, cooling, etc.
- Expect future technology and trend
## Planning
- Structured vs on-demand
- Current requirement & future growth
- Media type (fibre, Cat6, Cat6A)
- Apparatus (patch panel)
- ANSI/TIA-942 data centre standard cabling requirements
- Brand
## Structured Cabling System
- Lower risk of down time
- More manageable
- Easy re-patching
- Easy fault finding
- Better cooling (less blockage)
- Standardize length

## Copper Cable
- TIA-568
  - .1 copper
  - .2 fibre
  - .3 coaxial
- Shielded/unshielded
- Solid
  - Rigid
  - less loss
  - best used for permanent links
  - max 90m
- Flexible / Stranded cables
  - Flexible
  - Higher losses
  - best used for patch panel
  - max 10m
- Bottle neck
- Category
  - Cat5e = 100Mb/s, 1Gbps
  - Cat6 = 1Gbps, Cat6A = 10Gbps
  - Cat7 or 7A = 10Gbps (non-RJ45)
  - Cat8, 30m (40Gbps) or 100m (lower speed at 1-10Gbps), Shielded only
- Patch Panel
  - Flat
  - Angled

## Fiber
- Light travels
- No prone to EMF
- Longer distance
- Lightweight and smaller
- Single Mode
  - Laser only
  - 40 km
  - single light
- Multi Mode
  - LED (1Gb/s), Laser (10Gb/s)
  - diameter bigger
  - within building
  - more lights

## TIA-942 Cabling recommendatin
- Copper : Cat 6, 6A
- Fiber : OM4 or OM5
  - MPO-12,16,24,32 for termination more than 2 fibers
