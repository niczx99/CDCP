## Base of the rack
- Castor or feet
  - require shield to prevent air loss (air-flow barrier)
- Frame direct
  - less flexible but good air-flow barrier
 
## Colour of the rack
- White racks will result in higher light levels due to reflections

## Security of the rack
- Master key if not specified
- Electronic / Mechanical
  - key
  - biometric

## Power Strips
- C-13 (Female)
- C-14 (Male)

- Arrange racks as long as possible to trap cold air
  - but take escape path into considerations
