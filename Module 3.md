- Potential man-made hazards
  - Flight Path
  - Tunnel, lakes
  - Train station / airports
  - RF Towers
  - Power Distribution Network / power scarcity
  - Industrial pollution
- Proximity evaluation to emergency service / first responders
  - Fire, police, medical facilities
- Proximity to neighborhood (urban/industrial)
- Proximity to public transport and public roads
- Proximity to "high risk" targets
  - Embassies
  - Government Buildings (National Emergencies)
  - Power Stations (EMF)
  - Radio/TV stations (EMF)
- Security > Convenience
### Building
- Rent / Buy / Build : lease terms
- History of the building / area : flood or fire 
- Building codes : commercial or residential
- Level / floor : flood and security 
- Power Scarcity (Shortage)
- Spaces required for expansion
- Security : not easy access by unauthorized people
- Glass windows / panels : heat from the outdoor
- Floor loading : weight support
Building Evaluation:
- Slab to slab height (48U , 2 Meter)
- Power capabilities
  - Redundancy and capacity
- Network capabilities
  - Redundancy and diversity
- External supply capabilities
  - Re-fueling of standby generator tanks
  - Delivery of heavy/big equipment and route to data centre ( accessbility of the data centre )
### Holding area
Purpose 
- Provide an area where good can be received, unpacked, physically inspected and prepare for movement into the staging area.

Requirement; items have to be unpack before bringing into the DC to avoid dust and plastics
- Easy access for external supply (loading bay and route to staging room)
- Spacious
- Proper garbage disposal
- Secure; only authorized personnel is allow to access, arrange security, cctv to monitor the area
### Staging Area
Purpose
- Equipment can be acclimated, inspected and configure (H/W & S/W) and safety tested.

Requirement
- Separate and secure space
- Separate network ( development and prod )
- Separated PDU
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
### Computer / Server Room
Purpose
- Safe Production environment for servers/equipment to run 24x7 with minimal risk of interruption

Requirement
- Separate and highly secure space
- Protection and control of power quality
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
- Low EMF radiation levels
### Media Storage area
Purpose
- Safe, secure and conditioned environemnt to store documentation, magnetic media (tape)

Requirement
- Separate and secure space
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
  - Highly sensitive smoke detector
  - Fireproof safe / cabinet
### UPS
Purpose
- Provide a safe, secure and conditioned environment where power protection and conditioning system can operate on 24x7 basis

Requirement
- Separate and secure space
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
### Battery Room
Purpose
- Provide a safe, secure and conditioned environment where batteries can be stored

Requirement
- Separate and secure space; ideally separate with UPS room
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
- Vent
### Service Corrider
- Provide a secure area where supporting facilities can be serviced and monitored on a 24x7 basis without disturbing the computer room

Requirement
- Separate and secure space
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
### Standby Generator Set Room
- Provides a safe and secure area where the standby generator set can be located to allow for safe operation with minimal disturbance

Requirement
- Separate and secure space
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
- Fuel tanks could be located underground or above ground
### Meet-Me / Entrance Room
Purpose
- Safe Production environment where the carrier handover point equipment can be expected to run 24x7 with minimal risk of interruption

Requirement
- Separate and highly secure space
- Protection and control of power quality
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
### Securty Control Room
Purpose
- Security function to run on a 24x7 basis
- Sometimes combined with Facilities control Room and Security Control Room

Requirement
- Separate and highly secure space
- Protection and control of power quality
- Fire protection and other safety measure
### Facilities Control Room
Purpose
- For supporting facilities can be monitored and controlled on a 24x7 basis
- Sometimes combined with NOC and Security Control Room

Requirement
- Separate and secure space
- Protection and control of power quality
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
### Network Operation Control (NOC)
Purpose
- Monitor and control network and ICT infrastucture
- Sometimes combined with Facilities control Room and Security Control Room

Requirement
- Separate and secure space
- Protection and control of power quality
- Environmental controlled and monitored
- Fire protection and other safety measure
### Classic Mistake
- Main Switch board in the computer room
  - Subject to EMF and explosion risk
- UPS / Batteries in the computer room
  - Risks of batteryies and high-power modules
  - Maintenance may disrupt operation
  - EMF Risk
- Facilities Equipment area access via the computer room
- No separation for staging area
- No service corrider
  - Security risk; unauthorized access to servers while performing maintenace for facilities
  - Availability risk; maintenance of facilities might affect disrupt the operation
  - Maintenance
### Summary
- A good location, building are critical for long term success of a business site
- Power
- To avoid Natural hazards and Man-made hazards
- Areas to have like Holding Area, Staging Area to Separate Function Area
- Data centre facilities should work in harmony, separation is the best; Only go to specific area for specific component, will not disturb other components; combination are possible and acceptable
