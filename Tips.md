3.21             Classic Mistake

3.9, 3.10        Holding area vs Staging area

4.4, 4.5, 4.6    UDL, CL/PL, RL

4.11             Raise floor height min 40cm, preferred 60cm

4.12             Raise floor wire - SRG - low-impedence path for high frequency noise

4.14             Cutting holes - draw cross, do not touch line

4.15             Ramps - 1 to 12 ratio

5.2              Light measure by Lux

5.3              Room: 500 Lux min

5.4              L1 - CCTV, L2 - motion sensor, L3 - 500 Lux

6.4              Delta-T: Difference on Temp-in vs Temp-out

6.7, 6.10        Break before make; ATS: mechanical, < 50ms, STS: circuit, < 20ms

6.31             Grounding < 1 Ohm

6.36             K13 isolation transformer for DC

6.38, 6.39       DC: Form 3; Form 3 speration not at termination VS Form 4 separation including termination

6.43             IP - First Digit: protect against solid object penetration, Second Digit: Protection against water/moiture; higher number the better

6.47             Power quality: Voltage +/- 10%, Frequency: +/- 1%, CMN: < 1%, THDv: < 8%, THDi: < 12%; THDi creates THDv

6.62 to 6.67     VFD (worst) vs VI vs VFI (best, and for DC)

6.69             Eco-mode (VFI --> VI) vs Enhanced Eco-mode (VFI --> VFD); no benefit to poor power quality

7.3              E-field (Electric), H-/B-field (Magnetic); 10 mG (milligauss) = 1 microTesla

7.9              IEC 61000-4-8 equipment immune < 37.5 mG; NCRP human immune < 10 mG

7.11             Use tre-foil cable mgmt, or best busbar trunking

8.8              Best cooling - Mesh Door

9.4              Equipment Temp: 18C to 27C

9.9              Use only 1 cooling unit, Watt/KiloWatt (kW)

9.10             Sensible Heat: ICT, no moisture; Latent: Human, both sensible and moisture

9.14             Evaporator: remove heat, Compressor: keep refrigerant flow, Condenser: Reject heat to outdoor, Expansion valve: Control qualtity of refrigerant flowing

9.16             R410A is wel for DC

9.33             Aircond position: placed perpendicular to the hot asile

9.52             Self-containment Rack - Dielectric: safe for human and equipment; Refrigerant: safe for human and equipment (preffered)

12.5             VESDA and HSSD very sensitive

12.6             Smoke Detection: Ionization (Ion), Photoelectric (Photocell) not sensitive

12.8             Wet vs Dry - Dry with Preaction for DC

12.10 to 12.16   CO2, Inergen, Argonite natural gas

12.17            FE13 for High Ceiling

12.x             Handheld Extinguishers - Class C
